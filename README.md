## Introduction

In today's fast-paced development environment, understanding code deeply is crucial. The **Deep Code Reasoning MCP** provides a robust server that enables users to analyze and reason about code efficiently. By utilizing Google's Gemini AI, we offer enhanced capabilities in semantic analysis, hypothesis testing, and performance analysis.

## Features

- **Advanced Code Analysis**: Analyze code with state-of-the-art AI algorithms.
- **Reasoning Capabilities**: Understand the logic behind code structures and flows.
- **Debugging Tools**: Identify and fix bugs faster with intelligent insights.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Work with various models seamlessly.
- **Distributed Systems**: Operate in a distributed environment for scalability.
- **Performance Insights**: Get detailed reports on code performance.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Gain a deeper understanding of code semantics.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: For building the server.
- **TypeScript**: For strong typing and better maintainability.
- **Google's Gemini AI**: For advanced reasoning and analysis.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: To ensure efficient communication between models.
- **Distributed Systems**: For handling large-scale code analysis tasks.

## Installation

To get started with the **Deep Code Reasoning MCP**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/navabbx23/deep-code-reasoning-mcp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd deep-code-reasoning-mcp
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Access the server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it through a simple API. Hereâ€™s how to use the main features:

### Code Analysis

To analyze code, send a POST request to the `/analyze` endpoint with the code snippet in the body. 

Example:

```json
{
  "code": "function hello() { console.log('Hello, World!'); }"
}
```

### Debugging

Use the `/debug` endpoint to get insights on potential issues in your code.

### Performance Analysis

Send a request to the `/performance` endpoint to receive a performance report of your code.
